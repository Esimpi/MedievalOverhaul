  <DankPyon_LoneWolfStart.description>One year’s service—that was the deal. The lord whom I followed attempted many times to keep my sword by his side, but a deal is a deal and after one year, I swore no further oaths. As I traverse the wooded hills, I wonder to myself whether the decision was correct.

    I may have hoarded wealth, but bandits roam the countryside, and should my campfire not betray me, hungry beasts and monsters hidden in the dark eye me all the same. I often wonder if I should have allowed my lord to wield me as his sword again, but I also know that in doing so, I would forgo my freedom.
    
    So, after retrieving my silver, I march with no end in sight. Perhaps I will be so lucky as to find a homestead, build a hall, and gather my own household warriors. But the long-term goal seemed so far away, as I must focus on my foremost problems.
    
    First, I must survive.</DankPyon_LoneWolfStart.description>
